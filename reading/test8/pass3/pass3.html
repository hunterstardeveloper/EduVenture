    <h1>READING PASSAGE 3</h1>
    <p><strong>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3</strong></p>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="passage-box" id="readingText">
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Marketing and the information age</h2>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">A</strong> For the early practitioners of marketing in the 18th and early 20th centuries, the business of selling was simply a matter of continually finding new customers. By contrast, marketing managers in the current era recognise the importance of gathering information about the market and about potential customers. They recognise that if companies are to be profitable, customers must gain and retain their perceptions of value from the brands they buy over a long time frame, rather than from a single transaction. This also means that customers will continue to see value in returning continually to the stores where they shop, as well as to the service providers they deal with.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">B</strong> Marketing practitioners and marketing scientists have never worked more closely than they currently do. There are many reasons for this — among them the fact that the marketing industry is driving the convergence of telecommunications, media and technology so that new methods of buying can be tested. Customer expectations have risen as new technologies allow new approaches. For instance, the Discount-Super-TV shopping channel in Germany encourages its viewers to sign up for text messages and emails that tell them when their favourite artists and songs are about to be performed. New technology enables organisations to recognise which customers can be given greater attention, not just because they demand it but because it makes commercial sense to provide high levels of product quality and service.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">C</strong> Modern marketing information systems rely on information technology to enable marketing intelligence to be gathered and to store and analyse the information itself. Much of the information that is gathered by government bodies such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Statistics New Zealand, most of it is purposely designed by marketing organisations for client companies. In the process, computer technology is used to manipulate the data and then to present the information in such a way that executives can readily identify problems or issues, and quickly arrive at solutions.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">D</strong> In order to produce superior value and satisfaction for customers, marketing managers need information at every turn. They need information about customer end-users and resellers — as well as competitors — and governmental bodies that operate in the marketplace. One marketing executive put it this way: “To manage a business well is to manage its future,” and to manage the future is to manage information. This is why marketers view marketing information not just as an input for making better decisions but also as an important strategic asset and marketing tool. As household incomes increase, choices widen and buyers become better discriminating, so sellers need information about how buyers respond to different products and advertising campaigns.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">E</strong> The supply of information has also increased greatly. It has been suggested by the futurist and best-selling author John Naisbitt that the United States and, by observation, developed countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Singapore are moving from industrial to information-based economies. These post-industrial economies earn 70–80% of their Gross Domestic Product from services, and have entered what some commentators have termed the “Information Age” or the “Information Technology Era”.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">F</strong> One study found that with all the information now available through supermarket scanners, a packaged goods producer or retailer is bombarded with one million to one billion new numbers each week. As Naisbitt points out: running out of information is not a problem, but drowning in it is. Yet marketers frequently complain that they lack information of the right kind; or they claim that the information they have is too slow in coming and cannot be used strategically. Another concern is that information frequently becomes so widely spread throughout the organisation that it takes great effort to locate even simple facts. In addition, administrators complain that too much information may well reflect badly on their performance and an important letter or document arrives too late for them to act on it, as additional information is not acquired. So marketing managers need better information. Although marketing organisations have greater capacity to provide managers with information, they often do not use it well. As a result, many marketing organisations are now studying their marketing information needs and designing information systems specifically to meet those needs.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">G</strong> One solution is to use a Marketing Information System (MIS). This consists of people, equipment and procedures which, when put together, are able to gather, analyse, evaluate and distribute needed, timely and accurate information to marketing decision-makers. The MIS begins and ends with marketing managers. First, it interacts with these managers to assess the information needs they have. Next, it develops the needed information from internal records, marketing intelligence activities and the research process. The analysis unit processes the data to make it more useful and, finally, the MIS distributes it to managers in the right form and at the right time to help them make marketing decisions.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">H</strong> However, the costs of obtaining, processing, storing and delivering information can mount quickly. In some cases, additional information will do little to improve the manager’s decision, or the costs of obtaining the information will exceed the returns from the improved decision. For example, if an organisation estimates that marketing a new product without further information will yield a profit of $500,000, then it likely would not spend $30,000 for additional information that would increase the profit to only $525,000. By itself, information has no value — its value comes from its use.</p>
