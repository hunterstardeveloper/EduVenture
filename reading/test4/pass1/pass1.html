      <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Blockbuster Phenomenon: a new museum trend</h1>
      <p style=" font-weight: 600; font-style: italic;">Museums in Australia, like other pleasure-giving public organizations, are adapting their activities so that they more closely reflect the marketplace</p>

      <p>
        <strong style="font-size: 30px;">A</strong> since the 1980s, the term "blockbuster' has become the fashionable word for spectacular, high-profile museum exhibitions that have the ability to attract large crowds. A blockbuster is a "large-scale loan exhibition that people who normally don't go to museums will stand in line for hours to see" (Elsen 1984). Once the museum that created the exhibition has shown it to their local market, it can be offered to other organizations for a fee. This means that you can boost your someone else's door takings.</p>

      <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">B</strong>
      While partaking of the excitement of the blockbuster, visitors thus lured are likely to
      stay longer at the museum. Betty Churcher, when Director of the Australian National
      Gallery, Summed up the new blockbuster creed as follows: The bonus of the blockbuster
      exhibitions is that people come to see the blockbuster and they stay to lock at the
      permanent collection, so you are getting broader exposure for your collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style="font-size: 30px;">C</strong>Museums across the UK, USA, Canada and Australia currently operate under a
        system of plural funding: revenue raised through contributions by federal, state and/ or
        local governments, combined with revenue raised through admission charges and other
        activities, Maintaining and increasing visitor levels is this paramount and involves not only
        creating or hiring blockbuster exhibitions, but providing regular exhibition changes and
        innovations. In addition, the visiting public have become known as customers rather than
        visitors, and the skills that are valued in museums to keep the new customers coming
        through the door have changed. Curators are now administrators and being a museum
        director no longer requires an Arts degree-but public relations skills are essential if the
        museum is going to compete with other museums to stage traveling exhibition which draw
        huge crowds.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong style="font-size: 30px;">D</strong>The convergence of museums, they heritage industry, tourism, profit -making and
        pleasure-giving has resulted in the new "museology". This has given rise to much debate
        about whether it is appropriate to see museums primarily as tourist attractions. In literature
        from both UK and USA, the words that are starting to appear in some descriptions of
        blockbusters are " less scholarly", " non-elitist" and "popularist", while others extol the
        virtues encouraging scholars to co-operate on projects, and to provide exhibitions that cater
        for a broad selection of community rather than an elite sector, whatever commentators
        may think, manager of museums worldwide are looking for artful ways to blend culture and
        commerce, and blockbuster exhibitions are at the top of the list.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong style="font-size: 30px;">E</strong>But do blockbusters held in public institutions really create a surplus to fund other
        activities? If the bottom line is profit, then according to the records of many major
        museums blockbusters do make money. For museums in some countries, it may be the
        money that they require to replace parts of their collections or to fix buildings that are in
        need of attention. For some museums in Australia, it may be the opportunity to illustrate
        that they are attempting to pay their way by recovering part of their operating costs. Also,
        creating or hiring a blockbuster has many positive spin-offs: blockbusters mean crowds, and
        crowds are good for the local economy, provide increased trade for shops, hotels,
        restaurants, the transport industry and retailers. The arrangement that the arts provide
        sustained economic benefits has been well illustrated in impact studies in the USA and UK.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong style="font-size: 30px;">F</strong>However, blockbusters require large capital expenditure, and draw on resources
        across all branches of an organization, and the costs don't end there. There is a Human
        Resource Management cost in addition to a measurable " real" dollar cost. Receiving a
        touring exhibition draws resources from across functional management structures in project
        management style. Everyone, from general labourers to building services, front of house,
        technical, promotional, educational and administrative staff, is required to perform
        additional tasks. Furthermore, as an increasing number of institutions try their hand at
        increasing visitor numbers and memberships(and therefore revenue) by staging blockbuster
        exhibitions, it may be less likely that blockbusters will continue to provide a surplus to
        subsidize other activities due to the competitive nature of the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style="font-size: 30px;">G</strong>It has been illustrated in both the UK and USA that the blockbuster ideology has
        resulted in the false expectation that the momentum required to stage blockbusters can be
        maintained continually. Creating, mounting or hiring blockbusters is exhausting, with the
        real costs throughout an institution difficult to calculate. Secondly, as some analysts have
        argued, the " shop keeping " mentality and cost benefit analysis and a pure concentration
        on the bottom line, can squeeze substance out of an exhibition. Taking out substance can be a recipe for blockbuster failure and therefore financial failure
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong style="font-size: 30px;">H</strong>Perhaps the best pathway to take is one that balances both blockbusters and regular
        exhibitions. However, this easy middle ground may only work if you have enough space, and
        have alternate sources of funding to continue to support the regular, less exciting fare.
        Perhaps the advice should be to make sure that you find out what your local community,
        wants from you and make sure that your regular activities and exhibitions are more ending
