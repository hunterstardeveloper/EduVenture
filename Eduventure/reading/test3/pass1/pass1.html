      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Computer games</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center;">The early days of the video game business</p>

      <p>
      It's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game. In the age of computers, that
      statement takes on new meanings: video game cannot ever really be defeated because, no
      matter how high the score, it is always the human who tires first or makes the fatal error.
      But millions of people continue to play, because microelectronic technology has enabled
      game designers to conveniently and inexpensively transform plain screens into playfields of
      extraordinary capability. At the same time, a multi-billion dollar industry has grown from
      very humble beginnings in just a few decades.</p>

      <p>
      The technological roots of video games can be traced back to 1962, when an MIT
      (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) graduate student demonstrated Spacewar, a
      science-fiction fantasy game played on a mainframe computer and a large screen. That game
      immediately attracted a wide cult following among computer buffs. The next important step
      came in 1968, when a console was developed that could be used to play games on ordinary
      televisions. But it was not until the early 1970s that a young University of Utah engineer
      developed the technology to the point that adaptation of Spacewar from a large computer
      into coin-operated form for use in video game arcades was becoming economically feasible.
      Bushnell and his associates began working on such a machine in a converted bedroom
      workshop, but were unsuccessful. What they ultimately developed instead was a simple
      tennis-like game that they named Pong.
      </p>

      <p>
      Pong took the industry by storm and quickly became the first coin-operated video-game
      hit. And soon thereafter commercial Pong-style home video games also appeared. Yet
      despite early enthusiasm, consumer interest in this area proved less sustained than had
      been anticipated and, as prices started to drop and losses mounted, most of the early
      manufacturers withdrew from the field. Profits proved to be just as elusive at Bushnell’s
      company, Atari, where a rapidly growing market presence in coin-operated machines and
      home video required greater injections of capital and more professional management than
      the company was able to provide. In 1976, the founders of Atari sold their share of the
      company for a sum that was only equivalent to their sales in that year.
      </p>

      <p>
      At that point, coin-operated video games seemed just another passing fad. But the
      introduction of Space Invaders—an arcade model produced by the Japanese manufacturer
      Taito—proved otherwise. With its vibrant graphics, it was so different from the previous
      black-and-white games that Space Invaders immediately captured public interest. There
      soon followed a rush of popular video games that employed the same or better hardware
      and even more imaginative software. Of these, Pac-Man (in 1980) was especially significant,
      because now females began to take an interest.
      </p>

      <p>
      By this time, the same software improvements and technological advances (faster
      microprocessors and larger memories) that permitted designers to produce
      spectacular audio and visual effects for coin-operated machines were also being
      applied to home video units. It was thus only a short while before the programmable
      consoles that had been unpopular for lack of software suddenly began to sell in large
      numbers: consumers had discovered that they could finally play a reasonable version
      of their favorite arcade games in the comfort of their own home. The impact on Atari
      was astounding. Unprofitable for the first three years, Atari had by the end of 1979
      become a success. By either self-designing or licensing the most popular arcade
      concepts for cartridge format for use at home, the company had captured some 80%
      of the worldwide market for home video games.
      </p>

      <p>
      All of this, however, was too good to last. By late 1982, the public’s fascination with
      arcade games had begun to slow down, and fewer potential best-sellers were
      becoming available for conversion to cartridges that could be used on an Atari
      machine. At the same time, the market was flooded with illegal software of all types.
      It was thus not until the late 1980s that the unstructured nature of the industry—at
      least on the software side—had stabilized and become restructured in a manner
      similar, in many respects, to the book publishing business.
      </p>

      <h4>The melatonin shift</h4>

      <p>
      Until 1986, when Japan-based Nintendo introduced a more technologically
      sophisticated and user-friendly game console, the hardware side was also in disarray.
      But with tight control of software development and marketing, Nintendo was able to
      revive and then capture up to 80% of a once-again booming market in which no
      significant competition appeared until the early 1990s. By that point, the annual
      operating profits of Nintendo had already grown to over $1 billion—an amount
      exceeding the 1991 profits of all the major Hollywood film studios combined. In 1999,
      sales of game hardware and software, led by PlayStation, were equal in size (around
      $7 billion) to U.S. domestic box-office revenues.
      </p>

      <p>
      With change the only constant, the game industry has moved on to become what it
      is today. However, no matter what the technology or the format, the essence of a
      successful game will always be the same: it is simple to understand and to play on an
      elementary level, but it is compulsive and maddeningly difficult—in fact, forever
      impossible—to master fully.
