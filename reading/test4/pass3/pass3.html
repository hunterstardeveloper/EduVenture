      <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Placebo Effect</h2>
      <p><i style="font-weight: 600;">With the right encouragement, your mind can convince the body to heal itself. What is the mysterious force that can do this ?</i></p>

      <p>Want to devise a new form of alternative medical treatment? No problem. Here's
        the recipe. As a practitioner, be warm, sympathetic, reassuring and enthusiastic. Your
        treatment should involve physical contact, and each session with your patients should take
        at least half an hour. Encourage your patients to take an active part in their treatment and
        understand how their disorders relate to the rest of their lives. Tell them that their own
        bodies possess the true power to heal. Get them to pay you well. Describe your treatment
        in familiar words, but embroidered with a hint of mysticism: energy fields, energy flows,
        energy blocks, meridians, forces, auras, rhythms and the like. Refer to the knowledge of an
        early age: wisdom carelessly swept aside by the rise of blind mechanistric science. Oh, come
        off it, you're saying. Something like that couldn't possibly work, could it ?</p>

      <p>Well yes, it could -and often well enough to earn you a living. And a very good living if you are sufficiently convincing or, better still, really believe in you therapy. Many illness
      get better on their own, so if you are lucky and administer your treatment at just the right time you'll get the credit. But that's only part of it. Some of the improvement really would be down to you. Not necessarily because you'd recommended ginseng rather than chamomile tea o used this crystal as opposed to that pressure point. Nothing so specific.Your healing power would be the outcome of a paradoxical force that conventional medicine recognizes but remains oddly ambivalent about : the placebo effect.</p>

      <p>Placebos are treatments that have no direct effect on the body, yet still work
        because the patient has faith in their power to heal. Most often the term refers to a dummy
        pill, but it applies just as much to any device or procedure, from a sticking plaster to a
        crystal. The existence of the placebo effect implies that even a complete fraud could make a
        difference to someone's health, which is why some practitioners of alternative medicine are
        sensitive about any mention of the subject. In fact, the placebo is a powerful part of all
        medical care, orthodox or otherwise, though its role is often neglected and misunderstood.</p>

      <p>At one level ,it should come as no surprise that our state of mind can influence our
        physiology: anger opens the superficial blood vessels of the face; sadness pumps the tear
        glands. But exactly how placebos work their medical magic is still largely unknown. Most of
        the scant research to date has focused on the control of pain, because it's one of the
        commonest complaints and lend itself to experimental study. Here, attention has turned to
        the endorphins, natural substances produced in the brain that are known to help control
        pain. Any of the neurochemicals involved in transmitting pain impulses or modulating them
        at the University of Florida.
        might also be involved in generating the placebo response; says Don Price, an oral surgeon
      </p>

      <p>That case has been strengthened by the recent work of Fabrizio Benedetti of the University of Turin, who showed that.</p>

      <p>The placebo effect can be abolished by a drug, naloxone, which blocks the effects of
        endorphins. Benedetti induced pain in pressure cuff on the forearm. He did this several
        times a day for several days, using morphine each time to control the pain. On the final day,
        without saying anything, he replaced the morphine with a saline solution. This still relieved
        the subjects' pain: a placebo effect. But when he added naloxone to the saline, and blocked
        the endorphins, the pain relief disappeared. Here was direct proof that the relief of pain by
        a placebo is carried out, at least in part, by these natural opiates.</p>

      <p>Though scientists don't know exactly how placebos work, they have accumulated a
      fair bit of knowledge about how to trigger the effect. A London rheumatologist found, for
      example, that red dummy capsules made more effective painkillers than blue, green or
      yellow ones. Research on American students revealed that blue pills make better
      tranquiliser than pink, a colour more suitable for stimulants. Even branding can make a
      difference: if Aspro or Tylenol are what you like to take for a headache, their chemically
      identical generic equivalents may be less effective.</p>
      <p>It matters too how the treatment is delivered. Decades ago, when the major
        tranquilliser chlorpromazine was being introduced, a doctor in Kansas categorized his
        colleague according to whether they were keen on it, openly skeptical of its benefits, or
        took a let's try and see attitude. His conclusion: the more enthusiastic the doctor, the better
        the drug performed. A recent survey by Ernst on doctor's bedside manners turned up one
        consistent finding: Physicians who adopt a warm, friendly, reassuring manner are more
        effective than those whose consultations are formal and do not offer reassurance.
      </p>
      <p>Warm, friendly and I reassuring are precisely what alternative treatment is all about,of course . Many of the ingredients of that opening recipe-the physical contact, the generous swaths of time ,the strong hints of supernormal healing power-are just the kind of thing likely to impress patients. It's hardly surprising then, that complementary practitioners are generally best at moblishing ,the placebo effect, says Arthur Kleinman, professor of social anthropology at Harvard University .
