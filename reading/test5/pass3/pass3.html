    <h1>READING PASSAGE 3</h1>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Keeping the fun in funfairs</h2>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">A</strong>Fun is becoming a tricky issue for ride designers, in order to increase excitement, they have
      been ramping up the accelerations to create the most dizzying forces possible. But getting it right is far from easy. Err on the side of caution and people won't bother with a second ride. Go too far, however, and they may not be able to. Experts realize we are now at the limited of how much acceleration a human body can take, and designers are finding it hard to think up ways of keeping the public coming back for more. The problem is that true innovation has been lacking for a while, and fairground rides have become more about survival than actual enjoyment .So if our thrill-
      seeking bodies can rally take no more, what's going to keep dragging us back to amusement parks? Creating something new and exciting, yet safe, is going to take some careful thought.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">B</strong>when the Disney Corporation asked German designer Walter Stengel to design a giant loop ride
      for them in the 1970, he went to NASA, the aeronautics and space foundation, to discover the
      effects of sustained acceleration on the pilots, NASA's research suggests that the maximum level we
      can endure is 9 g.g being the standard unit of acceleration due to gravity. Go much beyond that and
      pilots pass out. Go further still and they suffer serious internal damage. So Stengel decided that the
      maximum vertical acceleration for the public should be 6, and then only for a second or so .What's
      more, he put firm restrictions on the rate at which acceleration can increase- you'll never go down a
      45 degree ramp into a tight circular loop, for instance.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">C</strong>But stricter safety limits only intensify the need to search for novel ways to thrill customers.
      Part of the problem is that no matter how exciting an attraction is after a few so the
      passengers will have some idea of what to expect. The next stage in designing rides, however
      could throw predictability out of the window This step has already been taken in the most
      recent waltzer's, or tea-cup rides Ride a waltzer and you' sit in a car that spins on its own
      axis. The car is on a huge platform that also rotates. In the past you could take comfort from
      the fact that the spin was tightly controlled by gears that turned your car at a rate determined
      by the rotation speed of the whole ride. But the latest generation of waltzer cars spin freely. at
      a fate determined by the weight and position of the people in them. So you never have the
      same experience twice. "People seem to like these "chaotic rides", says Stenge.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">D</strong>Although seemingly a passport to endless thrills chaos does have one rather obvious drawback
      it's unpredictable, Despite complex calculations, designers can never be completely sure that
      something odd won't happen, especially since freely turning systems occasionally hit a
      resonance frequency. For example, if pushed at a particular frequency, a child on a swing would
      go over the top of the swing's frame, Similarly, if you drive a revolving waltzer car at its
      resonance frequency it could speed up uncontrollably. This could be very hazardous, according
      to Stengel. H a ride is subjected to unforeseen stresses, no one can guarantee that it will be
      able to cope.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">E</strong>No one even knows what the safe limits of rotational force are, let alone its effect on the
      human body. Stengel has worked with the German Air Force, rotating volunteers head over
      heels while also making them cartwheel or pirouette like a ballet dancer. It emerged that if the
      pilots were turned on all three axes simultaneously, they became so nauseous they almost
      blacked out, and when they got off they couldn't walk. But what Stengel found particularly
      puzzling was that they also developed headaches and other problems about two days later.
      Since these effects aren't understood, he ties to limit how people on his rides are rotated.
      We want to provide fun, not pain.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">F</strong>what counts and that the way to make rides more fun s to put people through a carefully
      designed succession of relatively small accelerations. Other experts in this field agree, and it
      seems likely that designers could formulate profiles even for existing attractions that would
      lead to higher amusement value Recent experiments testing the tolerances of Dutch military
      plot o a range of accelerations have shown that tumbling around in machines doesn't have to
      be unpleasant When the force is kept low, the subjects actually enjoy the experience.

      With that goal in mind, Stengel feels that finging people around in ever more chaotic machines
      is no longer the way forward. He believes that the sequence of accelerations, not their size, is</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">G</strong>
        The fun seems to come from the unforeseen, particularly when an effect called the Coriolis
      Illusion comes into play. This is an agreeable tumbling feeling which occurs. for example, when
      the head is suddenly tilted while the subjeet is spinning with eyes closed. It appears that a roll
      which includes, for instance an unexpected change of acceleration from a small negative g-a
      feeling of weightlessness-to a small Positive a slight crushing sensation-has an
      extraordinary effect on people. If the theories of Stengel and other experts really do work,
      fairground fun might one day be measured in smiles, not screams.
