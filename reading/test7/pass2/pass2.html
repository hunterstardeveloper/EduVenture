<h1>READING PASSAGE 2</h1>

    <p style=" font-weight: 600; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">New ideas and some old ones</p>
    <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">A</strong>
      The traditional kampung houses of Malaysia do not need air-conditioning. Built on
      stilts and with steep roofs, they have year-round ventilation. The raised structure ensures a
      cooling breeze comes up through the floorboards, while the high roof acts as a chimney to
      release hot air. The airtight, concrete boxes of modern city construction, in contrast, are
      heat traps, says Muhammad Peter Davis of University Putra Malaysia. He has calculated
      that typical modern Malaysian houses are 5'C hotter than the air outside. The builders of
      kampung houses "had no knowledge of modern science or engineering but they came up
      with the perfect design,' says Davis.
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">B</strong>
          This story of ancient architectural sophistication and moder insanity is repeated
      around the world. In the name of modemnism, people have thrown away architecture
      designed to cope with the environment in which they live, and adopted house designs
      originating from cold, northern environments, where the idea is to keep heat in.
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">C</strong>
    Once, the aim of architectural modernists was to build structures that kept nature out
    and to replace it with air-conditioning. Now they are learning that they cannot do that
    effectively. Slowly, they are seeing the benefit of working with nature, rather than against it.
    In California, they probably use more power for air-conditioning than anywhere else on
    Earth. According to Arthur Rosenfeld from the University of California, what California
    needs is white paint. If Los Angeles painted its roofs white, planted trees to shade buildings,
    and chose lighter-colored paving, it could reduce city temperatures by 3'C and cut the
    annual air-conditioning bill by SUS 170 million a
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">D</strong>
      Modern buildings are greedy in their use of energy. Much is made of the contribution
      of transportation to global warming, through its emissions of greenhouse gases. But,
      globally, transportation is responsible for just 22 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions. The
      building sector is responsible for 31 per cent, mostly the result of heating and air-
      conditioning systems. In developing countries, where demand for electricity for buildings is
      rising by 5 per cent a year, the biggest demand is for air-conditioning in modem buildings
      which are often designed to cope with every different climatic condition.
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">E</strong>
          Before air-conditioning, much of the Arab world kept cool through thoughtful building design. Many buildings were built according to the principles of the wind tower, a tall structure with vertical vents at the top that open in all directions to catch any passing breeze. Typically, these wind-tower buildings were made of local materials sucha8 stone, mud brick, wood and palm-tree fronds, The buildings were inward-looking, which served the dual function of focusing attention on the courtyard, where family members spend time together, and protecting living areas from the rays of the sun.
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">F</strong>
      Throughout the Middle East today, wind towers are often little more than museum
      piece. But there are exceptions, Jordan has won awards for the architecture of a village on
      the shores of the Red Sea, which is designed to conserve energy. Made of rough, local
      stone in a traditional style, it combines the ventilation system of the wind towers for summer
      coolness with up-to-date heating and floor insulation to protect against the desert cold in
      winter
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">G</strong>
      Traditional building materials, like traditional building designs, are being rediscovered
      by those looking for low-energy solutions to the current construction needs. Clay is one
      such material: As the Dutch housing contractor R van der Ley has argued in promoting a
      series of clay housing projects in developing countries, clay has many benefits over its
      industrialized version, brick, Clay blocks cost only half as much as ordinary bricks. Clay
      also generates work because people can find it, mould it, bake it and work it themselves.
      Two hundred clay bricks can be made with the fuel oil that makes just one ordinary brick
      Moreover, clay is an
      be recycled.
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">H</strong>
      But although traditional methods and materials can be revived in appropriate
      settings, new green, low-energy technologies are needed, especially in urban
      environments. The thermal
      insulation of homes in cold countries is an example, In 1983, Sweden adopted a national
      standard, requiring the country's homes to loge no more than60 kilowatt-hours per square
      more over the year To meet that standard, windows were double-glazed, and walls and
      roofs insulated. Every home became a fortress against
      the rest of Europe has not followed the lead
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">I</strong>
      In the United States, Amory Lovins has promoted a range of low-energy
      technologies: 'superwindows', for example, which let in invisible light but can be 'tuned' to
      either allow in, or reflect away, infrared solar radiation - the stuff that heats. Buildings with
      large expanses of window (and big energy bills) can be designed to achieve optimum
      temperatures.
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">J</strong>
      As well as more efficient use of energy, the world also needs new sources of
      renewable power. Solar energy is being tried out in the developing world, in villages often
      far from electricity grids. The world's biggest solar power installation got underway in the
      Philippines, in 2001, where a project commenced to install solar panels for 400,000people
      in 150 villages. Such projects are demonstrating that countries, whether developing or
      developed, no longer need huge national grids to supply electricity. Every home can do its
      own thing with the help of a solar panel and a storage battery.
    </p>
    <p><strong  style="font-size: 30px;">K</strong>
      Houses, of course, are more than machines for living in. They are social and
      psychological spaces, too. Future houses may not look exactly like kampungs or wind
      towers or any other traditional models. But to work for us and for our environment, they will
      have to suit us as well as these traditional forms did.
