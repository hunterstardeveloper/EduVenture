      <h2 style="text-align: center;">A review of conformity and some of the studies that have been done on it</h2>

      <p>During your childhood, there will have been some kind of craze which affected all the people in your school. 
      It may have been to do with a particular toy or possibly a must-have item of clothing. 
      It may have been something as simple as a type of pen or as expensive as an electronic games console. 
      Fashion designers, toy manufacturers and anyone else involved in the retail trade love conformity. 
      Set up a craze, especially in the young, and everyone will go for it. In fact, it’s an ideal way to sell huge quantities of merchandise. 
      The levels of conformity in consumerism are phenomenal. When you actually stand back and consider how easily we are persuaded that having certain items is the only way we can ensure peace of mind, you see what an important concept conformity is.</p>

      <p>Conformity has been described as “yielding to group pressure” (Crutchfield, 1962). However, this implies that other people put pressure on us to make us conform and this is not always the case. 
      A better definition is given by Aronson (1976) who said it was a “change in a person’s behaviour or opinions as a result of real or imagined pressure from a person or group of people.” 
      This would make more sense, as often the pressure we feel is imagined. The person or group he refers to would have to be important to us at the time, regardless of their status.</p>

      <p>There has been considerable research on conformity. One of the first studies looked at the answers people gave when asked to estimate the number of beans in a bottle (Jennes, 1932). 
      If you have ever entered a “guess the number” competition, you probably looked at previous estimates and based your judgment on what other people had guessed. 
      This is more or less what happened in the Jennes study. First of all, he asked the respondents to give their own estimates, and then he asked them to decide a group estimate. 
      Finally, he asked them again alone and discovered that they had stayed with the group answer.</p>

      <p>Probably the most famous study on conformity was undertaken by Asch (1951) when he created a situation where many of his subjects gave answers which were blatantly untrue, rather than contradict the people they were with. 
      He did this by getting his subject to sit round a table with six stooges (colleagues of the experimenter) so that the subject was second to last. 
      He showed them all a large card which had three lines of different lengths drawn on it, labelled A, B and C. 
      He then gave them a card with a single line and asked them to match this in terms of length to one of the lines A, B or C.</p>

      <p>The stooges gave untrue responses in a number of the trials and the subjects were left in the situation where they either reported what they saw with their own eyes or conformed to the norm of the group. 
      When the results were assessed, they found that in one out of every three trials the wrong answer was given: the subject gave the same wrong answer as the stooges. 
      This led to an average level of conformity of 32 per cent. Asch interviewed his subjects after the trials to try to find out why they conformed to an answer which was so obviously wrong. 
      Most of them said that they did not want to cause problems within the group, although they felt heartened that when they did give wrong answers it made them anxious.</p>

      <p>Kelman (1953) outlined three processes which can explain social conformity. 
      The first is compliance, where subjects go along with the crowd to prevent hostility or bad feeling and to maintain group harmony. 
      However, they do not change their own private belief. 
      In the Asch study, the subjects were simply complying with the demands of the experimental situation but hadn’t internalized the group’s norms — they agreed in public but dissented privately.</p>

      <p>In internalization, subjects actually come to accept the group’s view as the more valid one. 
      Sometimes, however, subjects change their beliefs because they want to become more like their heroes — this is identification. 
      They may start to identify with that group and take on the group’s values and beliefs, even if they are different to their own. 
      This frequently happens with teenagers who want to become more like a peer group in order to be accepted, suddenly seeming to go against all the values and beliefs of their parents.</p>

      <p>So why is it that we have to conform? Some people feel confident most of the time, have high self-esteem and do not have to go along with the majority. 
      For most of us, though, how confident we feel varies from day to day depending on the situation we are in — and this can influence behaviour.</p>
