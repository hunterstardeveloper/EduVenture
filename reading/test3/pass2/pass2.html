<h1>READING PASSAGE 2</h1>
<p><strong>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2</strong></p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="passage-box" id="readingText">
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">A</strong> Work in engineering and technology is sometimes viewed as having little to do with art or human creativity. The imagery of assembly lines, robots, and computers often carries negative associations of repetitive labour, stress, and fears of job loss. These concerns can overshadow the positive values of technological progress. At the same time, immense engineering works such as the Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge are praised as majestic achievements, celebrated both as engineering triumphs and as symbols of their cities. The relationship between art and engineering has rarely been simple or consistent.
    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">B</strong> The assembly line system made famous by Henry Ford is often criticised for reducing workers to mere parts of a vast industrial machine. Yet photographers like Lewis Hine demonstrated that even within such systems, beauty and artistry could be found. His photographs highlighted the dignity of individual workers, such as one tightening a bolt with a wrench, revealing striking patterns of form and composition. Around World War I, Hine documented the construction of New York’s Empire State Building. He captured unforgettable images of workers perched high above the city, often risking his own life to photograph them suspended on cables or casually eating lunch atop steel girders.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">C</strong> When Ford’s massive River Rouge factory opened in 1927, artist and photographer Charles Sheeler was commissioned to create a visual record of it. The world’s largest automobile plant became one of Sheeler’s most fascinating subjects, and he described the experience of photographing it as the most thrilling artistic challenge he had ever encountered.
    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">D</strong> Long before Hine or Sheeler, other artists had recognised the artistic and human qualities within engineering and technology. Nowhere is this clearer than in the Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron in Ironbridge, Shropshire, UK. In the late 1700s, Abraham Darby cast the iron ribs for the world’s first iron bridge — a bold departure from traditional stone and timber structures commonly depicted in landscape art. Still spanning the River Severn today, the Iron Bridge inspired countless paintings. In Michael Rooker’s late-18th-century portrayal, the entire landscape radiates outward from the bridge, emphasising it as the central, celebrated feature rather than an intrusion on nature.
    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">E</strong> During the 19th century, the rise of railways sparked new artistic inspiration. Steam engines soon became as familiar and natural in paintings as grazing animals in the foreground. The Impressionist Claude Monet, for example, painted both flower gardens and the bustling Gare Saint-Lazare railway station in Paris. By the 20th century, engineering, industry, and technology had become fully accepted — even popular — subjects for artists.
    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">F</strong> American artist Joseph Pennell depicted buildings wrapped in scaffolding and scenes of heavy industry during World War I. He is especially remembered for his prints of the Panama Canal as it reached completion, and of monumental structures such as the Hell Gate Bridge under construction. Pennell often repeated his belief that “Great engineering is great art.” Although he claimed to know little about engineering, he considered engineers to be the greatest architects since the ancient Greeks. He described the feeling of watching a grand construction project as experiencing the “Wonder of Work,” seeing every completed bridge, skyscraper, or dam as a memorial to human achievement.
    </p> 
    <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">G</strong> Today, one of the most innovative engineers is Santiago Calatrava, who is also trained as an architect. His bridges and public structures are designed on a human scale and stand as sculptures as much as functional buildings. In the United States, project planners increasingly seek engineers and architects who collaborate with artists, recognising the added cultural value such cooperation creates. This growing appreciation for the artistic dimension of engineering ensures that more masterpieces — like the Brooklyn Bridge — will continue to emerge. These structures will remain noble monuments of civilisation and inspiring subjects for artists of every kind.
