    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Saving the Bittern</h2>
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">A</strong> 
      The bittern, A British waterbird, does not have a good record as far as survival is
      concerned. By 1886, habitat destruction and other pressures had pushed it close to
      extinction. Fortunately, it recovered a few decades later, and in 1950 the numbers of nature
      male bitterns rose to a peak of about 70. By the 1980s, however, it was clear that the bird
      was in trouble again. The bittern needs extensive wet reedbeds to survive, and long periods
      of drainage, pollution and lack of management had destroyed most of its habitat. By 1997, it
      again faced imminent extinction. To prevent this, the British government set up a plan for
      the bittern, aiming to establish a population of 50 males by 2010. However, this target was
      reached six years early, a rate of recovery faster than anyone had dared hope for. We at the
      Royal Society for the Protection of Birds(RSPB) now claim the bittern as one of Britain's
      greatest wildlife success stories ,since figures reveal that the number of these rare birds has increased fivefold in just seven years.
    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">B</strong> 
      Bitterns have feathers that help them to conceal themselves and a shy nature; they
      usually remain hidden within the cover of reedbed vegetation. Our first challenge was to
      develop standard methods to monitor their numbers. The booming call of the male bittern
      is its most distinctive of feature during the breeding season, and we developed a method to
      count them using the sound patterns unique to each individual. This not only allowed us to
      be much more certain of the number of booming males in the UK, but also enabled us to
      estimate local survival of males from one year to the next.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">C</strong> 
      Our first direct understanding of what breeding bitterns require in their ideal habitat
      came from comparisons of reedbed sits that had lost their male birds with those that
      retained them. This research showed that bitterns had been retained in reedbeds where the
      natural process of drying out had been slowed through management. Based on this work,
      broad recommendations on how to manage and rehabilitate rehabilitate reedbeds for
      bitterns were made, and funding was provided through a European Union(EU) wildlife fund
      to manage 13 sites within the core breeding range.
    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">D</strong> 
      To refine these recommendations and provide fine-scale, quantitative habitat
      prescriptions on the bitterns' preferred feeding habitat, we started radio-tracking male
      bitterns on the RSPB's Minsmere and Leighton Moss reserves. This showed clear
      preferences for feeding in the wetter reedbed areas, particularly within reedbed next to
      larger open pools. The average home range sizes of the male bitterns we followed (about 20
      hectares) provided a good indication of the area of reedbed necessary when managing or
      creating habitat indication of the area of reedbed necessary when managing or creating
      habitat for this species. Female bitterns undertake all the incubation and care of the young,
      so it was important to understand their requirements as well. Over the course of your
      research, we located 87 bittern nests and found that female bitterns preferred to nest in
      areas of continuous vegetation, well into the reedbed, but where was still present during
      the driest part of the breeding season

    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">E</strong> The success of the habitat prescriptions developed from this research has been
      spectacular. For instance, at minsmere, male bittern numbers gradually increased from one
      to ten following reedbed lowering, a management technique designed to halt the drying out
      process. After a low point of 11 mature males in 1997, bittern numbers in Britain responded
      to all the habitat management work and started to increase for the first time since 1950.
    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">F</strong> bittern chicks. To do this we fitted small radio tags to young bittern chicks in the nest, to
      determine their fate through to fledging, when they begin to fly ,and beyond. Many chicks
      did not survive to this stage, and starvation was found to be the most likely reason for their
      demise. The fish prey fed to chicks was mainly those species penetrating into the reed edge.
      So, an important element of recent studies has been development of recommendations on
      habitat and water conditions to promote native fish populations. Once independent, radio-
      tagged young bitterns were found to seek out new sites during their first winter, a
      proportion of these would remain on new sites to breed if the conditions were suitable. A
      second EU-funded project aims to provide these suitable sites in new areas. A network of 19
      sites developed through this partnership project will secure a more sustainable UK bittern
      population with successful breeding outside of the core area, less vulnerable to chance
      events and sea level rise.The final phase of research involved understanding the diet, survival and dispersal of
    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong style="font-size: 30px;">G</strong> all of the increase occurred on those sites undertaking management based on advice
      derived from our research. What rescuing the bittern, the work has helped a range of other
      spectacular wetland species such as otters. Although science has been at the core of the
      bittern story, success has only been achieved through the trust, hard work and dedication of
      all the managers, owners and wardens of sites that have implemented, in some cases very
      drastic, management to secure the future of this wetland species in the UK.
      By 2004, the number of booming male bitterns in the UK had increased to 55. Almost
