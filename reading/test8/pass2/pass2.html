<h1>READING PASSAGE 2</h1>
<p><strong>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2</strong></p>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Boring buildings</h2></p>
      <p style=" font-weight: 600; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">There could be more than an economic or nostalgic price to impersonal retail and high-rise construction; boring architecture may take an emotional toll on the people forced to live with it.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">A</strong>
        A growing body of research in cognitive science illuminates the physical and mental
        toll bland cityscapes take on residents. Generally, these researchers argue that
        humans are healthier when they live surrounded by variety or work in well- designed,
        unique spaces, rather than unattractive, generic ones. Urban policy professor Justin
        Hollander and architect Ann Sussman review scientific data to help architects and
        urban planners understand how, exactly, people respond to their built surroundings,
        particularly at work. People, they argue, function best in intricate settings, not 'big,
        blank, boxy offices'
      </p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">B</strong>
        Indeed, that's what Colin Nellard, a neuroscientist at the University of Waterloo in
        Canada, has found in his work. Five years ago, Nellard became interested in a
        certain building - the gigantic Whole Foods Market 'plopped into' a notoriously
        textured part of lower Manhattan in New York. Nellard partnered with the
        Guggenheim Museum to analyze what happens when someone walks out of a tiny
        neighborhood restaurant and encounters a full city block with nothing but 'the long,
        blank facade of the Whole Foods Market' building.
        <br>
        In 2011, Nellard led small groups on Lower East Side walks to measure the effect of
        the urban environment on them. Participants recorded their response to questions at
        each stopping point and wore sensors that measured skin conductance, a response
        to emotional excitement. Passing the monolithic Whole Foods Market, people's state
        of arousal plummeted. Physiologically, Nellard explained, they were bored. To
        describe this place, they used words like 'bland' and 'passionless'. In contrast, one
        block east at the other test site - a 'lively sea of restaurants with lots of open doors
        and windows' - people measured high levels of excitement, and they listed words like
        'lively', and 'socializing'. Nellard explains that the main objective of urban design
        should be to produce some kind of novelty or change every few seconds; otherwise,
        we become cognitively disengaged.
      </p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">C</strong>
        The trick, it seems, is to design a world that excites but doesn't overload our faculties
        with a constant barrage of information. 'We are, as animals, programmed to respond
        to thrill,' said professor Brendan Walker. In Walker's 'thrill laboratory' at the University
        of Nottingham in the UK, devices measure heart rate and skin conductance to see
        how people respond to adrenaline-producing experiences such as a roller-coaster
        ride. A thrilling encounter moves us quickly from a state of equilibrium to a desirable 'disorientation'. 'Humans want a certain element of turmoil or confusion,' he said. 'Complexity is thrilling whether in an amusement park or architecture.'
      </p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">D</strong>
        Psychologists have found that awe-inspiring moments can potentially improve our
        well-being. One study conducted by Melanie Rudd, Kathleen Vohs and Jennifer
        Aaker of Stanford University in the US showed that the feeling of 'awe' can make
        people more patient and less materialistic. In an experiment, the researchers
        showed students 60-second clips of waterfalls, whales, or astronauts in space. After
        only a minute of virtual images, those who said they were awed also felt less
        pressed for time. And in another variation, people made hypothetical choices
        between physical and experiential goods of equal monetary value. Those who had
        just 'felt awe' were more likely to choose an experience over a possession, a choice
        that is linked with greater satisfaction in the long run. In other words, a visual buzz -
        whether architectural or natural - might have the ability to change our frame of mind,
        making modern-day life more satisfying and interactive.
      </p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">E</strong>
        It's important to note, however, that architectural boredom isn't about how pristine a
        street is. People often confuse successful architecture with whether an area looks
        pleasant. On the contrary, when it comes to city buildings, people often focus too
        narrowly on aesthetics, said Charles Montgomery, author of Happy City:
        Transforming Our Lives Through Urban Design. Some of the happiest blocks in New
        York City, he argues, are 'kind of ugly and messy'.
        <br>
        In 2014, Montgomery's Happy City lab conducted an experiment in which he found a
        strong correlation between messier blocks and pro-social behavior. Montgomery
        sent researchers, posing as lost tourists, to places he coded as either 'active' or
        'inactive' facades. He concluded that the former had a high level of interest, that is
        they were messy, while the latter had no special features such as long warehouse
        blocks. Pedestrians at active sites were nearly five times more likely to offer
        assistance than at inactive ones. Of those who assisted, seven times as many at the
        active site offered use of their phone.
      </p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">F</strong>
        Fortunately, it's not necessarily a dichotomy - new architecture can achieve the
        optimal level of cacophony and beauty. Take the 2006 Hearst Tower in midtown
        Manhattan. Designed by architect Norman Foster, Hearst Tower is a glass-and-steel
        skyscraper, 40 stories of which are designed in a triangular pattern, differing in style
        from the 1920s Art Deco base. From the outside, the facade jolts city dwellers from
        their daily commutes, while energizing employees who enter it each morning. For
        many who walk by, Hearst Tower's design may not be the easiest to understand; it's
        both sleek and old. The top looks like it traveled from the future. Inside, workers
        travel upon diagonal escalators, up a three-story water sculpture, through the tower's
        historic atrium, flooded with light. Few New Yorkers who pass by would find this
        building boring. And they're likely to be happier - maybe even nicer to each other -
        because of it.

    <p>
      Norman Foster's Hearst Tower was built in 2006. The 40-storey modern triangular-
      patterned building is made of glass and steel, contrasting with the base which is in the style
      of the 1920s. The sight of the building's <strong>24. </strong> <input type="text" id="q24" style="width: 150px; display: inline;" placeholder="Answer"> has a striking impact on commuters and employees.
