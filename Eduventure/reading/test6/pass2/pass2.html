<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Voynich Manuscript</h2></p>

    <p>The starkly modern Beinecke Library at Yale University is home to some
    of the most valuable books in the world: first folios of Shakespeare, Gutenberg Bibles and manuscripts from the early Middle Ages, Yet the library's most
    controversial possession is an unprepossessing vellum manuscript about
    the size of a hardback book, containing 240-odd pages of drawings and text of
    unknown age and authorship. Catalogued as MS408, the manuscript would attract little attention were it not for the fact that the drawings hint at esoteric knowledge,while the text seems to be some sort of code - one that no-one has been able to
    break. It's known to scholars as the
    Voynich manuscript, after the American book dealer Wilfrid Voynich, who bought the manuscript from a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912.</p>

    <p>Over the years, the manuscript has attracted the attention of everyone from amateur dabblers to top codebreakers, all determined to succeed where countless others have failed. Academic research papers, books and websites are devoted
    to making sense of the contents of the manuscript, which are freely available to
    all "Most other mysteries involve secondhand reports,' says Dr Gordon
    Rugg of Keele University, a leading Voynich expert. But this is one that
    can see for yourself.</p>

    <p>It is certainly strange: page after page of drawings of weird plants, astrological symbolism and human figures, accompanied by a script that looks likesome form of shorthand. What does it sayand what are the drawings about? Voynich himself believed that the manuscript was the work of the 13th- century English monk Roger Bacon,
    famed for his knowledge of alchemy, philosophy and science. In 1921 Voynich's view that Bacon was the writer appeared to win support from the work of William Newbold, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, who claimed to have found the key to the cipher system used by Bacon. According to Newbold, the manuscript proved that Bacon had access to a microscope centuries before they were supposedly first invented, The claim that this medieval monk had observed living ceils created a sensation. It soon became clear, however, that Newbold had fallen victim to wishful thinking. Other scholars showed that his 'decoding' methods produced a host of possible interpretations. The Voynich manuscript has continued to defy the efforts of world-class experts.</p>

    <p>In 1944, a
    team was assembled to tackle the mystery, led by William Friedman, the renowned American codebreaker. They began with the most basic codebreakinq task: analysing the relative frequencies of the characters making up the text, looking for signs of an underlying structure. YetFriedman's team soon found themselves in deep water. The precise size of the 'alphabet' of the Voynich manuscript was unclear: it's possible to make out more than 70 distinct symbols among the170,000-character text. Furthermore, Friedman discovered that some words and phrases appeared more often than expected in a standard language, casting doubt on claims that the manuscript concealed a real language, as encryption typically reduces word  frequencies.</p>

<p>Despite the doubts, the manuscript was not dismissed as fraudulent. Early scholars were influenced by wishful thinking, but later investigators used more systematic analysis. In 1944, a London codebreaker proposed the first structured approach, later refined by American experts. They studied the statistical patterns of the writing, searching for linguistic structure, but found that the characters did not behave like those of real languages.</p>

<p>Cryptanalyst William Friedman concluded that the manuscript most plausibly represents an artificial language, where words are constructed from concepts rather than traditional linguistic roots. This idea impressed scholars such as John Chadwick, decipherer of Linear B, who suggested the structure resembled a form of shorthand. However, the manuscript’s nature remains unproven.</p>

<p>A major debate concerns whether the manuscript could be a hoax. Although the script appears meaningful, decorative writing can sometimes look complex without containing real information. Yet the sheer length of the manuscript raises doubts about whether a hoaxer would invest so much effort.</p>

<p>In 2004, computer scientist Gordon Rugg demonstrated that a 16th-century technique could generate “Voynich-like” text. His results suggested the manuscript might be a sophisticated hoax. Critics, including René Zandbergen of the European Space Agency, argued that Rugg’s method did not match several structural features of the genuine manuscript.</p>

<p>Linguist Jacques Guy supported Friedman’s view that the manuscript might represent an invented artificial language.</p>

<p>Using a method first described by the Italian mathematician Girolamo Cardano in 1550, Rugg built special tables to quickly create random-looking text. This might explain how the manuscript’s creator produced so many pages. Critics argue, however, that Rugg’s technique does not reproduce the statistical richness of the Voynich manuscript.</p>

    <p>What is clear is that the book-sized transformed codebreaking: the computer. manuscript kept under lock and key at Yale University has lost none of its fascination. "Many derive great intellectual manuscript's language. pleasure from solving puzzles,' says The insights so far have been Rugg. The Voynich manuscript is as challenging a puzzle as anyone could ask
    perplexing. For example, in 2001 another for.</p>

        People sometimes say that <strong>22. </strong> <input type="text" id="q22" style="width: 150px; display: inline;" placeholder="Answer">
        is of little interest to lawyers, who are more concerned with making money. This may well be the case with some individuals, in the same way that some <strong>23. </strong> <input type="text" id="q23" style="width: 150px; display: inline;" placeholder="Answer"> or scientific experts may also be driven purely by financial greed. However, criticizing lawyers because their work is concerned with people's problems would be similar to attacking IT staff or <strong>24. </strong> <input type="text" id="q24" style="width: 150px; display: inline;" placeholder="Answer">
        for the same reason. In fact, many lawyers focus on questions relating, for example, to housing or civil liberties, which requires them to have <strong>25. </strong> <input type="text" id="q25" style="width: 150px; display: inline;" placeholder="Answer"> to their work. What's more, a lot of lawyers' time is spent writing <strong>26. </strong> <input type="text" id="q26" style="width: 150px; display: inline;" placeholder="Answer"> rather than dealing with people's misfortunes.
