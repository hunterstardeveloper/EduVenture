      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Theories of planet formation questioned</h2>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">A</strong> The traditional view of astronomy has been that Planets form slowly as material congeals
      within the disk of gas, dust and ice known to surround young stars. First, gravity gathers
      together bits of dust that merge to form boulder-sized bodies, which themselves coalesce
      into bigger and bigger objects. In about a million years, these form rocky planets like
      Earth and Mar Over the ne few million years, gas from the disk settles around some of
      these solid bodies and they crow far larger, becoming giants like gaseous Saturn and
      Jupiter. This theory of planet formation is known as the care-accretion model. However,
      several astronomers now say that this model for making planets may not be entirely
      correct.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">B</strong> These astronomers have devised an alternative theory in which planets as massive as
      Jupiter, whether orbiting our sun or a distant star, would form completely within a few
      hundred years, rather than millions of years as previously believed. Both theories for
      planet formation start with the same reservoir of planet-making materials, The spinning
      cloud of gas, dust and ice rapidly fattens into disk-like shapes known as proto-planetary
      disks: and, as time goes by, gravity causes material in these disks to clump into planet-
      sized objects. However it is the speed of the clustering, and the size of the initial clumps,
      that provide the disparity in the two models for planet formation.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">C</strong> According to the core-accretion model, the making of Jupiter required the initial formation
      of a solid core five to ten times Earth's mass, It would have taken about a million years to
      achieve this. Most astronomers believe that the large core then had enough gravity to
      attract a huge amount of gas from the proto-planetary disk to create a planet of the
      massive proportions of Jupiter. In this core-accretion model, these 'gas giants may take
      as long as ten million years to form.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">D</strong> That is several million years too long in the opinion of Lucio Mayer of Zurich University.
      Direct telescope sightings suggest that the proto-planetary disks do not last more than
      about seven million years, and studies of the environment in which stars form suggest
      that many disks may evaporate in much less time, Mayer asserts that most stars in the
      Milty Way form in dense clouds of gas, dust and ice. Their temperatures are very intense
      and the ultraviolet light they send into space can evaporate a proto-planetary disk in less
      than 100,000 years. In the core-accretion model, that is not enough time for a Jupiter-like
      planet to form.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">E</strong> Recent computer simulations show that when individual stars form, the gravitational pull
      between them can result in the outer gaseous parts of the proto-planetary disks being
      destroyed in 100 000 years or less. Thus, Thomas Quinn of the University of Washington
      concludes that if a 'gas giant' planet cannot form quickly, it will probably never form. He
      also asserts that if the core-accretion model is correct. Gas giant planets like Jupiter
      should be rare. However, since 1995, astronomers have found more than one hundred
      planets as large as Jupiter outside our solar system.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">F</strong> Quinn and his colleagues recently analysed the standard core-accretion model of planet
      formation and investigated whether not giant planets could form quickly. They looked
      at the work of Gerard Kuiper who, in the 1950s, proposed that they could. Alan P Boss of
      the Carnegie Institute did more extensive work on the subject in the late 1980s. Using
      computer simulations, he was surprised to find that ratty could cause a proto-planetary
      disk. after a few orbits of its parent star, to break into clumps as big as an average- sized
      planet. The clumps would continue to pull in gas, ice and dust. This is called the
      gravitational-instability model of planet formation.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">G</strong> Recent calculations have suggested that many of the solid bodies that might be the rocky
      core for Jupiter-size planets in the traditional theory would pin into the parent star before
      the massive planet could form. Moreover, further analysis has shown that other effects
      could also cause a proto-planetary disk to become unstable and split into large fragments.
      For instance, within the disk, electrically charged material might accumulate, leading to
      fragmentation of the disk. Or a powerful gravitational disturbance, such a he pull of a
      star passing nearby, could produce instability in the proto-planetary disk.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">H</strong> Nevertheless, the gravitational-instability model has problems of its own, as it is
      mathematically complicated and requires sophisticated computer use. Therefore, no one
      has studied the simulations long enough to establish conclusively that the model allows
      for the formation of massive planets.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">I</strong> In response, Mayer says that he and his team have described the results of an extensive
      simulation based on the gravitational-instability model. They spent two years refining
      calculations to track what would happen to a proto-planetary disk over one thousand
      years, which is more than any other simulation had done. In addition, over a decade
      previously Mayer and his team had made simulations of the formation and evolution of
      galaxies. In doing this, they had already developed a fast computer code that could run in
      parallel on machines with hundreds of processors, and this knowledge assisted them in
      investigating their gravitational-instability theory.</p>
