<h1>READING PASSAGE 2</h1>
<p><strong>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Born to trade</strong><br>
    Long before our ancestors had any trappings of civilisation, they had a taste for material
    goods. Kate Douglas discovers where this ancient obsession has led us.</p>

    <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">A</strong> Humans are born to trade, and we don't need shops or money to do it — the
    heart of commerce is an instinctive ability for what anthropologists call reciprocity.
    This is an ability to exchange goods of equal worth and it evolved as the brains of
    our ancient ancestors and societies became more complex, allowing individuals to
    keep a running tally of their interactions with others. Evidence from modern hunter-
    gatherers leaves little doubt that the exchange of food and favours is innate, as is the
    ability to keep track of the credits and debits that accrue as a result. Combine this
    skill for mental bookkeeping with even the most basic material culture, and trade
    inevitably follows.</p>

    <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">B</strong> Once trade gets off the ground, the economic benefits quickly make it
    irresistible. But exchanging tools, food and other essentials of life in a barter
    economy is a far cry from the shopping mall. Modern consumerism goes far beyond
    subsistence and utilitarianism to encompass everything from Gucci handbags and
    BMW convertibles to valuable paintings. Clearly, the worth of such goods is not
    inherent but resides in certain intangible qualities that we invest in them. When did
    humans start holding these goods in such high esteem?</p>

    <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">C</strong> All the archaeological evidence for the flowering of consumer culture has up to
    now pointed to a date of around 40,000 years ago. That’s when early modern
    humans started making increasingly intricate bone and stone tools, carving patterns
    into rocks and creating representational art such as figurines, jewellery and cave
    paintings. However, discoveries in Africa are pushing the origins of consumerism
    much further back. Findings from Blombos cave in South Africa show thousands of
    pieces of ochre — many over 100,000 years old — which must have been imported
    from 30 kilometres away, likely through trade. Although ochre can be used to treat
    animal hides, researchers believe the Blombos ochre had a symbolic purpose. It is
    mostly red, and the surfaces show signs of scraping, indicating use as pigment.</p>

    <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">D</strong> Even more intriguing were 41 beads dating from 76,000 years ago, found in
    clusters and made from tiny mollusc shells. The shells have consistent holes and
    wear marks showing they were rubbed against thread or clothing. Earlier bead
    finds in Africa dated only to 45,000 years ago. Evidence from Tanzania also hints at
    bead-making debris dating as far back as 280,000 years. Although we do not know
    exactly how these beads were used, their modern equivalents are often traded. It
    seems our taste for personal adornment is far older than previously believed.</p>

    <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">E</strong> But why did we come to value such objects? In many animals, individuals signal
    genetic fitness through striking displays. Some researchers believe consumer
    products play a similar role in humans. Archaeologist Aimee Plourde argues that
    even in egalitarian societies, some individuals gain prestige because of superior
    hunting skills, craftsmanship, environmental knowledge, or connections. Prestige
    brings social benefits, so people advertise their abilities by possessing items that
    are hard to fake — for example, a hunter wearing the tooth of a dangerous animal.
    Competition for prestige leads to a rise in the value and variety of such goods,
    helping push societies toward hierarchy, agriculture, and eventually civilisation. We
    may no longer be impressed by beads, but modern equivalents — like a man
    spending €670,000 on a Bugatti Veyron — reveal the same ancient desire for status.</p>

      <h3>Why certain object are valued?</h3>
      <p>
        Some researchers argue that we may use ownership of desirable goods to
        demonstrate our strength and fitness as other <strong>22</strong><input type="text" id="22" style="width: 50px; display: inline;" placeholder="A-J">uses their attractive physical
        features. Showing off one's superiority is not a new phenomenon and even in
        ancient times successful people would have gained <strong>23</strong><input type="text" id="23" style="width: 50px; display: inline;" placeholder="A-J"> from this. A desire for
        status could have led to an increase in the worth of prestige goods and to <strong>24</strong><input type="text" id="24" style="width: 50px; display: inline;" placeholder="A-J">
        among people wishing to achieve this status.
        It is thought that our natural desire to trade provided a basis for organised farming
        and <strong>25</strong><input type="text" id="25" style="width: 50px; display: inline;" placeholder="A-J"> development and finally resulted in the complex societies which can be
        seen today. Whilst we do not value things such as beads nowadays, other items
        hold the same appeal for us and bring the same status as owing beads did for our
